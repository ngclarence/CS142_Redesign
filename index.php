    <p>We wanted a simple and modern layout that relies on people's existing familiarity with other professional websites. Since this is a website used for educational purposes, we wanted students to be able to easily navigate the different sections and to have all the information well organized and legible. To assist the user, all hyperlinks are clearly visible with an underscore. The indentation and padding are adjusted to help distinguish different sections and also follow the pattern of the text being left aligned. The hover affects are added to the calendar to help the user see what their cursor is hovering. The images are left on the CSS but taken out on the print style CSS. The images were resized and moved to fit our design. The process of designing our website design went very smoothly. All of the group members were able to communicate effectively and efficiently. We arranged times to meet during the week and we usually gathered at the library where we worked together very well. We divided the tasks of what we should do by our strengths. If there were any questions or concerns about how the website appeared, we were able to rely on our group and solve the problems together. Overall, we were able to do a good job together and it was fun.  </p>
